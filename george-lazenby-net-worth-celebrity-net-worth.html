Lazenby described how he was unhappy about how little his input had been considered in his first film and decided he was happier making commercials and pursuing other acting opportunities. However, he did occasionally play the role of Bond again, though not in feature James Bond films, in various parodies and unofficial Bond projects.</p><p>Lazenby made his next film in 1971, "Universal Soldier," which he helped write. He described the film as "anti-guns and anti-Bond." In 1972, he appeared in "Who Saw Her Die?" and received positive reviews for his performance. In 1973, he appeared in "Play For Today" on the BBC.</p><p>After this time, Lazenby said he was broke, having spent all the money he had earned from portraying Bond. However, he then made three films for Golden Harvest â€“ "Stoner," "The Man from Hong Kong," and "A Queen's Ransom" â€“ from 1974 to 1976. He then returned to Australia to act in a few commercials and television films.</p><p>Lazenby then moved to Hollywood in the late 1970s in an effort to reactivate his career. He did land roles in projects like "Hawaii 5-0," "Evening in Byzantium," and "Superboy." Throughout the early 1990s, he appeared in a number of television projects and made for television movies. He also lent his voice t0 a 2019 audiobook project, "Passport to Oblivion."</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Lazenby married his three-year girlfriend, Chrissie Townson, in 1973.

Lazenby and Townson later divorced.</p><p>In 2002, Lazenby married <a href=#>Pam Shriver</a>, a former tennis pro. The couple had three children, including twins in 2005. They filed for divorce after a six-year marriage.</p><p>Lazenby lives in Brentwood, Los Angeles in California.
