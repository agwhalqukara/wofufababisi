However, after watching herself in one particular scene she swore it off.</p><p>“There’s this emotional scene where I’m firing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Richard Gere</strong></a> and my forehead didn’t move. I thought: ‘Well, that’s not working!’”</p><p>During this same period, she said she also tried<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> lip fillers</a>, but didn’t do that again either. Why? “One day I came home and my kids laughed at me,” she revealed. “I thought: ‘OK, that’s that!’”</p><p>Now she embraces her natural beauty more than ever, sharing unfiltered and non-glam versions of herself seemingly without fear. When the reporter asked how she was able to fight the norm of staying <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">youthfully gorgeous</a> in Hollywood, she revealed that it was her mom who influenced her carefree and confident sense of self.</p><p>“Part of it is my mom rarely wore makeup and I loved seeing her face evolve over time with me,” she said. “I want my kids to look at the face that they know and understand that it’s just me. Everyone has their vanity but I – I – hmmm. How to put this? I … just … don’t care that much!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Sleepless in Seattle actress spoke to the British outlet about her recent experience <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">overcoming the coronavirus</a> with her husband <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tom Hanks</strong></a>. “I think that having the virus at the same time made it that little bit easier,” she explained. “We were taking care of each other instead of having the pressure of taking care of one person and no one taking care of you or understanding that the person at home needs a break. We were fortunate we were in a place where we understood what the other was going through.”</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6e2ta2MsKClq5%2BjerC8xKecnWWlpXqirs6uq2asmJp6cnnToqSeZaOdsm6yxKWrZqiimsC0wdGeZK2nXZyytXnBqKuosF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-billy-dee-williams-spouse-teruko-nakagami.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Billy Dee Williams Spouse Teruko Nakagami?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./foster-moreau-meet-his-girlfriend-bio-wiki-age-career-net-worth-2023-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Foster Moreau: Meet his Girlfriend, Bio, Wiki, Age, Career, Net Worth 2023 and More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./awra-briguela-bio-wiki.html>Awra Briguela Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./be-less-than-perfect.html>Be less than perfect</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./father-of-pop-art-claes-oldenburg-dies-at-93.html>Father of Pop Art, Claes Oldenburg, dies at 93</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gillian-mckeith-net-worth.html>Gillian McKeith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hailey-bieber-net-worth-how-rich-is-american-model-and-actress-in-2022.html>Hailey Bieber Net Worth: How Rich Is American Model And Actress In 2022!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
