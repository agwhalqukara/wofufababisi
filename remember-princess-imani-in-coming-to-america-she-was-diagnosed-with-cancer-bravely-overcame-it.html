Years after, she battled cancer and ultimately overcame it.</p><p class=dh>Vanessa Bell Calloway started her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tvovermind.com/vanessa-bell-calloway/>career</a> as a dancer, but she shifted to acting where she starred in the likes of "What's Love Got to Do with It," "Shameless," "Saints & Sinners," and of course, the classic comedy "Coming to America."</p><p class=dh>Fans of the movie were in for a treat after Calloway and Murphy reprised their roles as Prince Akeem and Princess Imani Izzi respectively on <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://amzn.to/3s5YYVL>"Coming 2 America."</a> Although she's remained active in the industry for decades, she actually underwent a minor setback when it came to her health.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>GOD'S SUBTLE REMINDER</strong></p><p class=dh>In 2009, Calloway felt as if something was wrong. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.ebony.com/entertainment/in-her-words-vanessa-bell-calloway-shares-her-breast-cancer-survival-story/>described</a> the situation saying that one day, she felt as if God was whispering in her ear, telling her that something was wrong.</p><p class=dh>Even though she wasn’t in any pain, she asked her physician to get every test possible, so he ordered a CAT scan, blood work, and a mammogram, which she was supposed to get four months before that visit to the doctor. True enough, she was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma, an early stage of breast cancer.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE TEST RESULTS</strong></p><p class=dh>Unfortunately for Calloway, her assumptions were right. A nurse called her a couple of days after the tests were done and said there were suspicious calcifications in her right breast.</p><p class=dh>At the time, she realized that God was warning her about that. She was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma. In her own words, it <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.ebony.com/entertainment/in-her-words-vanessa-bell-calloway-shares-her-breast-cancer-survival-story/>meant</a> that “the abnormal cells in the milk ducts have fallen out into the tissue to invade the rest of the breast. It’s stage zero of breast cancer.”</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>UNDERGOING A MASTECTOMY</strong></p><p class=dh>Doctors made her do a lumpectomy twice, but even the second surgery didn’t eliminate the problem. In the end, she had to undergo a mastectomy. Upon finding out, she revealed that she was angry. Speaking about the situation, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.ebony.com/entertainment/in-her-words-vanessa-bell-calloway-shares-her-breast-cancer-survival-story/>said:</a></p><p class=dh>“I had a hard time coming to grips with my condition, but my husband and sister turned it around, reminding me 'it’s just a breast. Let it go.'"</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE OUTCOME</strong></p><p class=dh>Thankfully, the surgery was a complete success. Apart from getting rid of the malignant cells in her breast, she got reconstructive surgery too, where a plastic surgeon used skin from the soft tissue on her waistline to replace it.</p><p class=dh>As for what she's learned from the situation, she revealed it's not taking life for granted. She adviced for others to take care of themselves and to regularly check in with their doctors to make sure everything is on track.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/952c29739c2b9fb2ab4a4652da0fa4821306381574755921.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Vanessa Bell Calloway attends the Premiere Of Focus Features' "Harriet" at The Orpheum Theatre | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>LOVING HER LIFE</strong></p><p class=dh>Years later, Calloway is living her best life. In fact, she admits to waking up worry-free, sometimes even forgetting that she once had cancer. Aside from her work, Calloway is a happy wife to Anthony, whom she's been married to since 1988.</p><p class=dh>This August, she marked <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CSXqyVwhLFu/>12 years</a> since she started having annual mammograms since her bout with cancer. She encouraged other women to undergo the same test to make sure everything is right and well in their bodies.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>A WOMAN OF POWER</strong></p><p class=dh>In 2019, she was recognized as one of the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://rollingout.com/2019/07/26/vanessa-calloway-women-of-power-honored-at-national-urban-league-conference/>"Women of Power"</a> at the National Urban League Conference. Along the honorees were Kimberly Blackwell, Marilyn F. Booker, Esther L. Bush, Freda C. Lewis-Hall, and Tanya Pratt.</p><p class=dh>Ultimately, the actress shared through her speech on that day that being recognized validates the fact that she's working hard to be the best person she can be. It is also a reassurance that the path she's chosen is inspiring others enough to take note of what she's doing.</p><p class=dh>Now, fans can see her most recent work on <a class="me a" href=#>"Coming 2 America."</a> Although she initially <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/2021/02/15/vanessa-bell-calloway-believes-her-skin-tone-affected-coming-to-america-casting/>wanted</a> the role of Lisa and not Imani, she didn't want to pass up on the opportunity to star alongside Eddie Murphy and the rest is history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmprb21nZXqzscyepJudomK9s7XNnJysq12euqK6yGaaqKWZo7RurcyeqaKbkWLAb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-and-charlize-battle-it-out-shooting-their-latest-film.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will and Charlize battle it out shooting their latest film</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./reginald-collins-metropolitan-funeral.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Reginald Collins Metropolitan Funeral</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./awra-briguela-bio-wiki.html>Awra Briguela Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./be-less-than-perfect.html>Be less than perfect</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./father-of-pop-art-claes-oldenburg-dies-at-93.html>Father of Pop Art, Claes Oldenburg, dies at 93</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gillian-mckeith-net-worth.html>Gillian McKeith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hailey-bieber-net-worth-how-rich-is-american-model-and-actress-in-2022.html>Hailey Bieber Net Worth: How Rich Is American Model And Actress In 2022!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
