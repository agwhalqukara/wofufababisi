You go through men faster than Taylor Swift,” Ginny responds in the episode — a quote that Swift shared on her Twitter account.</p><p>Howey, 31, exclusively revealed to Us Weekly that one of the biggest reasons she was drawn to the show was because of how many women were involved.</p><p>“When I went to do the chemistry read and throughout the audition process,<a href=#> it was all women</a>. I’ve never been in that situation or an audition where the majority of the people in the room are women — let alone, they’re all women,” the Exorcist alum told Us last month. “Everyone from creator, showrunner, executive producer, casting director to the lead [were women]. So that was incredibly empowering and exciting.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Taylor-Swift-Calls-Out-Ginny-Georgia-for-Sexist-Joke-2.jpg><p>Swift, who has been kept her relationship with the actor<a href=#>&nbsp;</a>relatively private since they started dating in 2017, <a href=#>was previously linked</a> to <a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Calvin Harris</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>John Mayer</strong></a>.</p><p>In November 2020, the “Exile” songstress revealed that <a href=#>her song “Peace” is a lot about her relationship</a> with the Harriet actor, 30, and the perception of their relationship.</p><p>“‘Peace’ is actually more rooted in my personal life. I know you have done a really excellent job of this in your personal life: carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you <a href=#>do fall in love and you meet someone</a>, especially if you’ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living. I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives,” she told <a href=#><strong>Paul McCartney</strong></a> in Rolling Stone at the time. “I can’t control if there’s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The 10-time Grammy winner later addressed how her relationship has changed her.</p><p>“I think that in knowing him an<a href=#>d being in the relationship I am in now,</a> I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids,” Swift said. “Whether that’s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture—the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it’s really just trying to find bits of normalcy. That’s what that song ‘Peace’ is talking about. Like, would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWjoa6uv4ygoKemqWK0prvRoKCaZZakv26%2FxLGgrKxdn7yssYyamaitpGK1pr6O</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./walter-keane.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Walter Keane</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./prefix-that-means-the-opposite-of-post.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prefix that means the opposite of post-</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./awra-briguela-bio-wiki.html>Awra Briguela Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./be-less-than-perfect.html>Be less than perfect</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./father-of-pop-art-claes-oldenburg-dies-at-93.html>Father of Pop Art, Claes Oldenburg, dies at 93</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gillian-mckeith-net-worth.html>Gillian McKeith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hailey-bieber-net-worth-how-rich-is-american-model-and-actress-in-2022.html>Hailey Bieber Net Worth: How Rich Is American Model And Actress In 2022!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
