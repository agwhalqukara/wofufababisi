The world will always remember the singer for his powerful voice and steadfast capacity to keep a fading genre of music alive. Toward the end of his life, Sinatra dealt with declining health. <a href=#>His final words</a> were a heartbreaking declaration after an illustrious and moving career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Frank-Sinatra-13.jpg><h2 id=h-frank-sinatra-s-wife-said-his-health-was-improving-one-month-before-his-death>Frank Sinatra’s wife said his health was improving one month before his death</h2><p id=par-2_38>At the beginning of 1997, Sinatra had a heart attack that left many tabloids speculating about his health. Rumors abounded that Sinatra was on his death bed, rumors that his wife Barbara fiercely disputed in April of 1998.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_33>“The rumors are just crazy. You can’t believe it. He’s doing very well. You’d think they’d just stop with it,” she told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Las Vegas Sun</a>. “He’s strong and walking around.

Barbara said that it was just because he valued his private life.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_22>“He’s a very private man,” she explained. “He feels very strongly about his private life and his financial life being kept private.”</p><h2>The singer spoke his last words to his wife and close friend</h2><p id=par-6_33>Just a month after the interview with Barbara, Sinatra died of a heart attack. At the time of his death, Sinatra was with his close friend and manager Tony Oppedisano and wife Barbara.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_49>“His two doctors and a number of technicians were surrounding him when I walked in,” Oppedisano told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mirror</a>. “I sat by him and held his hand, trying to keep him calm. Then his wife Barbara arrived and told him to fight. He struggled to speak because of his breathing.”</p><p id=par-8_11>At that point, Sinatra looked them and uttered his final words.</p><p id=par-9_14>“He just looked up at the two of us and said curtly: ‘I’m losing.’”</p><p id=par-10_11>Despite the grim proclamation, Oppedisano said that Sinatra didn’t seem upset.</p><p id=par-11_47>“He wasn’t panicked,” he said. “He was just resigned to the fact that he had given it his best but he wasn’t going to come through. I told him I loved him but those were the last words I ever heard him say before he passed away.”</p><h2>Frank Sinatra was buried with some surprising items</h2><p id=par-12_40>Sinatra was buried in Cathedral City, California, just outside of his beloved Palm Springs. His family shared that they placed&nbsp;<a href=#>several items in his coffin</a>: a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey, a Zippo lighter, a pack of Camels, and 10 dimes.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_14>Sinatra always had phone change on him after the 1963 <a href=#>kidnapping of his son</a>.</p><p id=par-14_35>“I think it came from Frankie’s kidnapping, maybe before,” his daughter Tina said on&nbsp;Larry King Live, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AP</a>. “He never wanted to get caught not able to make a phone call. He always carried 10 dimes.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Frank Sinatra was buried in 1998 with bottle of Jack Daniels, roll of dimes (for use in a pay phone), Tootsie Rolls, package of Camels, and Zippo lighter: <a href=#>#Life</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UHRjENVhgu</a></p>— Michael Beschloss (@BeschlossDC) <a href=#>December 29, 2017</a></figure><p id=par-15_20>His former wife Mia Farrow also slipped her wedding ring and a note to Sinatra into the casket with him.</p><p id=par-16_11>“We really wanted him to have a big sendoff,” Tina explained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSzs63NpGSsoZ6WwbOt0maamq2jmnqlscCtn2aglZa%2Fta7RnpikoZ6ceq2t0q1ksKeimcBvtNOmo2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gregory-jean-jr-behind-false-wall-allegedly-in-video-sweeping-roof-of-house.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gregory Jean Jr behind false wall allegedly in video sweeping roof of house</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./florence-pugh-clapped-back-at-vulgar-critics-of-her-see-through-valentino-dress.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Florence Pugh Clapped Back at &amp;quot;Vulgar&amp;quot; Critics of Her See-Through Valentino Dress</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./awra-briguela-bio-wiki.html>Awra Briguela Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./be-less-than-perfect.html>Be less than perfect</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./father-of-pop-art-claes-oldenburg-dies-at-93.html>Father of Pop Art, Claes Oldenburg, dies at 93</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gillian-mckeith-net-worth.html>Gillian McKeith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hailey-bieber-net-worth-how-rich-is-american-model-and-actress-in-2022.html>Hailey Bieber Net Worth: How Rich Is American Model And Actress In 2022!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
