The young woman recently visited her grandmother's Hollywood star.</p><p class=dh>After years of building her career in the entertainment industry, Suzanne Somers amassed several fans, supporters, and friends who turned into family. Many of them were deeply saddened by the news of her recent passing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c951c395f03cd7d5e30e1d8558b1d919d6ee3718e15ba8003a5162524e3b1c4a.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Screenshot of Violet, Suzanne, and Camelia Somers' photo during an interview with Access Hollywood. | Source: YouTube/Access Hollywood</p><p class=dh>Despite being busy with a Hollywood career, Suzanne still managed to form a deep bond with her grandchildren, including her granddaughter Violet Somers.</p><p class=dh>Violet recently shared a photo on her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/violetsomers/>Instagram</a> visiting Suzanne's Hollywood Walk of Fame Star, which had letters and flowers on top of the site. Violet didn't add much context to her post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d21827b3a5319a35366f0fbf6098a1a5a2dbdcf0362fa8723336e79a921c17fb.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Screenshot of Violet Somers' Instagram story, visiting Suzanne Somers' Hollywood Walk of Fame Star. | Source: Instagram/VioletSomers</p><p class=dh>However, a few days ago, she shared the last birthday letter she penned to her grandmother, whom she referred to as Zannie. In it, Violet listed the many things she would miss about the actress, including the handwritten birthday cards she sends, the sound of her voice when she sings, and the times she eats cake.</p><p class=dh>Violet also shared some of Suzanne's favorite songs, including "Frim Fram Sauce," "Someone to Watch Over Me," and "A Song for You." The granddaughter <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cye_g5qLPZp/?img_index=1">added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I wish you the warmest welcome into the other realm [...]. You'll be so loved. And some day when I go, you'll be the first person I hug. We'll cook together again and go shopping [...]."</p><p class=dh>According to Violet, her grandmother visited her through a beautiful <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hoQa86cpXA">yellow butterfly</a> after the actress passed away. Interestingly, she asked Suzanne to visit her as a yellow butterfly before her death. Violet continues to pay tribute to her grandmother by wearing the sentimental jewelry Suzanne owned.</p><p class=dh>Suzanne also has another granddaughter, <a class="me a" href=#>Camelia Somers</a>, who looks much like her. A few weeks before her death, Suzanne shared a photo with Camelia, showing their strong physical resemblance. Like Violet, Camelia's grandmother is dear to her heart.</p><p class=dh>Violet, Camelia, and their family have kept their grandfather Alan Hamel, Suzanne's husband of over 40 years, company to help with the pain. So far, Violet believes Hamel has been grieving better than they thought because of his family's support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1obXBoZnq0wdmapaedXai8rrHRrGSgqpGjsaWt1KCfrZ2iYr%2BmucSmmZ6qo2O1tbnL</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-david-nihill-net-worth-2024-wiki-real-name-age-height-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is David Nihill Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./khachanov-kids-does-khachanov-have-children.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Khachanov kids: Does Khachanov have children?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./awra-briguela-bio-wiki.html>Awra Briguela Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./be-less-than-perfect.html>Be less than perfect</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./father-of-pop-art-claes-oldenburg-dies-at-93.html>Father of Pop Art, Claes Oldenburg, dies at 93</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gillian-mckeith-net-worth.html>Gillian McKeith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hailey-bieber-net-worth-how-rich-is-american-model-and-actress-in-2022.html>Hailey Bieber Net Worth: How Rich Is American Model And Actress In 2022!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
