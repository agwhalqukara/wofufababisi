Here’s a look at Why Is Tucker Carlson Leaving Fox News?</strong></p><p>Tucker Carlson is an American conservative political commentator and writer born on May 16, 1969.</p><p>He gained popularity as the host of the nightly political talk show Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News, a position he held from 2016 to 2023.</p><p>During his tenure, Carlson became known for his controversial and divisive opinions on various political and social issues, including immigration, race, and gender.</p><p>Despite facing criticism and calls for boycotts from some segments of the public, Carlson remained one of the most-watched cable news personalities, with millions of viewers tuning in to his program each night.</p><p>In 2023, Carlson announced his departure from Fox News, leaving many to speculate on his future career moves.</p><p><strong>Also View: </strong><a href=#>Bethany Funke Parents And Family Ethnicity: Idaho Survivor Siblings</a></p><h2>Why Is Tucker Carlson Leaving Fox News -Fired Or Resigned?</h2><p>On April 24, 2023, Fox News announced that Tucker Carlson, the host of his evening show, was immediately dismissed from the network along with his show’s executive producer.</p><p>Fox did not provide any reason for his termination, leading to media speculation that it was due to various factors.</p><p>One potential reason is the recent defamation settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, which Fox News was forced to pay out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/live-blog-20230424-tucker-carlson-fox-news-header-3-pbkm-articleLarge.jpg><p>Another reason could be Carlson’s internal criticism of Fox leadership, which has been known to cause tensions within the network.</p><p>Furthermore, a pending lawsuit from former Fox producer Abby Grossberg alleging an “appalling work environment while working on Carlson’s show” could also be a factor.</p><p>Reports suggest that Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox News, decided to dismiss Carlson.</p><p>Carlson’s last broadcast was on April 21, and a rotation of guest hosts will fill the slot until a permanent replacement is found.</p><h2>Where Is Tucker Going?</h2><p>Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, is set to join the list of nightly news hosts who left their networks after commanding huge audiences, and many of them continued their careers elsewhere with mixed results.</p><p>Bill O’Reilly, the onetime host of “The O’Reilly Factor,” now hosts a political opinion podcast and runs a news and commentary website.</p><p>Glenn Beck departed from Fox News in 2011 to begin his online news venture, which included The Blaze, a news and video website, and he also hosts a radio show and podcast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

network.</p><p>Based on the experiences of his predecessors, Carlson may follow in their footsteps and start his online venture, such as a podcast or news website.</p><p>It remains to be seen what his next move will be.</p><h2>Tucker Carlson: Net Worth</h2><p>Tucker Carlson is a well-known conservative political commentator who has gained a significant following over the years.</p><p>He is best
