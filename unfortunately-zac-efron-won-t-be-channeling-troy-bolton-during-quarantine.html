It has nothing to do with cast drama.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>We could all use a spoonful of sugar to help this quarantine go down, and ABC is coming to the rescue. On April 16, the network will air "<a href=#>The Disney Family Singalong</a>," an hour-long TV event featuring celebrities like Ariana Grande, Demi Lovato, and Darren Criss singing more than a dozen of your favorite Disney songs.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most talked-about numbers is "We're All in This Together" from the hit Disney Channel original movie High School Musical, which will reunite a majority of the film’s main cast members. Sadly, <a href=#>Zac Efron</a> won’t be belting out the signature anthem with the rest of his co-stars, but the actor is still scheduled to make a cameo.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Zac Efron not singing during "The Disney Family Singalong"?</h2><p>A majority, if not all, of the musical numbers were recorded ahead of Thursday’s broadcast, and HSM director Kenny Ortega said Zac’s absence is due to a timing issue.&nbsp;</p><p>"We couldn’t reach Zac until late but when we did, he immediately jumped in, of course," the choreographer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, adding that the 32-year-old will deliver a special message during the program.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney Channel</span></figure><p>"Everyone we reached out to was quick — and you’ll see it in their spirit and the way they come together from their homes," Kenny shared. "They recognize this is an opportunity to strengthen spirits for those joining us for the broadcast."</p><p>In addition to appearances by HSM's Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Corbin Bleu, Monique Coleman, and Lucas Grabeel, the performance will also include the stars of Descendants, <a href=#>Zombies</a>, and <a href=#>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</a>.</p><p>"There are young people out there that look up to these people and have for a long time," Kenny explained. "To see them in their own living rooms and in their sweatpants hanging out with their families helps everyone realize there’s truth behind these words — we’re all in this together in various circumstances."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Can Zac Efron really sing?</h2><p>He may not be showing off his singing abilities on primetime, but make no mistake, the California native can carry a tune. Though his voice was blended with Drew Seeley’s for the original HSM soundtrack, Zac came out swinging in HSM2 and HSM3: Senior Year, recording a total of 20 original songs between the two films.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney Channel</span></figure><p>"I had to put my foot down and fight to get my voice on these tracks," Zac previously told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Orlando Sentinel</a>. "I'm very fortunate that Drew has gotten proper credit [for the first film] and also that I've gotten the opportunity to come back and try it again with my own voice."</p><p>Zac also demonstrated his vocal range in the 2007 film adaption of Hairspray, playing heartthrob Link Larkin, and performed duets with Hugh Jackman and Zendaya in 2017’s The Greatest Showman.&nbsp;</p><p>At the latter project’s premiere, Zac told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> that it felt great to sing and dance on screen again. "This is a real neat one too. It's just different," he noted of the P. T. Barnum biographical drama. "The movie is very powerful and has a lot to say. I think it's an important one for our generation…"</p><p>"The Disney Family Singalong" airs Thursday, April 16 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZLOZk2Kyp77Op2Snp6RiwKq6xqKloGWUnsCvsdhmqqKml5a5sLrG</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-nawaal-akram-net-worth-2024-bio-age-height-family-comedic-style-and-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Nawaal Akram Net Worth 2024: Bio, Age, Height, Family, Comedic Style, And More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sarkodie-accused-of-music-theft-american-artiste-ne-yo-is-the-original-composer-of-do-you-as.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sarkodie accused of music theft; American artiste Ne-Yo is the original composer of Do You as</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./awra-briguela-bio-wiki.html>Awra Briguela Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./be-less-than-perfect.html>Be less than perfect</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./father-of-pop-art-claes-oldenburg-dies-at-93.html>Father of Pop Art, Claes Oldenburg, dies at 93</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gillian-mckeith-net-worth.html>Gillian McKeith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hailey-bieber-net-worth-how-rich-is-american-model-and-actress-in-2022.html>Hailey Bieber Net Worth: How Rich Is American Model And Actress In 2022!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
