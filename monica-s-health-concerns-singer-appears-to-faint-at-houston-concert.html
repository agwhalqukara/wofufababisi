A singer and songwriter appeared to have had a frightening experience at a Houston concert on Saturday.</p><p>According to video footage obtained by TMZ on Monday, the “Boy Is Mine” singer appeared to pass out in the middle of her concert in Houston, Texas, on Saturday night.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Later, a figure with those same light locks appears and passes out at the side of the stage, being quickly carried away from the spotlight by a member of the crew.</p><p>According to fans on X, the “For You, I Will” hitmaker, 43, appeared to faint on the side of the stage before a crew member whisked her away and into an ambulance. They say she arrived late, at 10:35 p.m., and people were leaving by 11:05 p.m. Concertgoers say something seemed off.</p><p>“The fans are saying <a href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=1577>Monica</a> left in an ambulance after passing out near the stairs,” one social media user claimed, noting that something “felt off” throughout the concert.</p><p>Her representatives have yet to comment on the incident, so specifics are unknown. However, the musician has previously spoken out about her health issues, including mitral valve prolapse, which began while she was on tour at the age of 18.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PeepsWiz-Official-2024-01-02T235610.864-1024x576.jpg><p>According to the Mayo Clinic, the disease occurs when the flap that separates the upper and lower chambers of the heart fails to close properly.</p><p>Monica, who has also been hospitalized for high blood pressure and endometriosis, discussed her heart valve condition with the Huffington Post in 2016.</p><p>She recalled losing consciousness while performing “Angel of Mine” at a concert in Washington, D.C.</p><p>“Everything around me started to fade from color to black and white,” she explained.</p><p>“I walked to the side of the stage to request assistance and collapsed into the arms of one of our staff members.”</p><p>The mother of three is thought to have been hospitalized for nearly a month while doctors investigated what caused the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She eventually returned to touring and is scheduled to perform several shows over the next two months.</p><p>Monica also has two sons, Rodney, 19, and Romelo, 16, with her ex-fiancé Rodney ‘Rocko’ Hill. From 2003 to 2010, they dated on and off.&nbsp;</p><p>She later married NBA player Shannon Brown in 2010, and the couple has a 10-year-old daughter named Laiyah.</p><p>In March 2019, she filed for divorce from the athlete.</p><p>Then there is this… several fans took to social media to speculate about an incident at Monica’s show in Bayou City.</p><p>“What happened to Monica at the Houston concert?” one X user wondered. “The Houston streets are talking!” said another. Monica is said to have left in an ambulance after passing out near the stairs.”</p><p>Monica, 43, has several shows coming up in the American Southeast on her tour, which may add to the star’s stress.</p><p>Note- Monica has yet to make a statement about the alleged incident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51ktbC4y7KuqKeUZLqwusicmKxlmJqurcDHZpqoppOav6%2B%2FjKygp5%2BVp3qivM%2BemKurXam8brLAoqWtZZGpeqm71KyrqKZdmLyvr8Srq2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-snyder-obituary-legendary-braves-scout-paul-snyder-has-passed-away.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paul Snyder Obituary: Legendary Braves scout, Paul Snyder Has Passed Away.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ludovica-caramis-net-worth-bio-age-husband-height-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ludovica Caramis- Net Worth, Bio, Age, Husband, Height, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./awra-briguela-bio-wiki.html>Awra Briguela Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./be-less-than-perfect.html>Be less than perfect</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./father-of-pop-art-claes-oldenburg-dies-at-93.html>Father of Pop Art, Claes Oldenburg, dies at 93</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gillian-mckeith-net-worth.html>Gillian McKeith Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hailey-bieber-net-worth-how-rich-is-american-model-and-actress-in-2022.html>Hailey Bieber Net Worth: How Rich Is American Model And Actress In 2022!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib.
