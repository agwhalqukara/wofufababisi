He attended elementary and high school there. He developed an interest in music from a young age as well and was a big fan of rock music. With friends, he began playing in bands in high school.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Scantlin was a founding member of the rock and grunge band, Puddle of Mudd, in 1992. The band's name was inspired by their practice space ,as they practiced near a levee of the Missouri River which meant that the area surrounding their studio was constantly wet and muddy. The band released their debut EP, "Stuck," in 1994 followed by a demo album, "Abrasive," in 1997. Scantlin performed vocals in the band and also played the guitar.</p><p>Over the next few years, the membership of the band shifted and three new members joined.

A couple of years later, in 2004, while playing a show in Ohio, Scantlin admitted to the audience he would be unable to continue playing as he was too intoxicated. Scantlin's relationship with drugs and alcohol led to many issues within the band during their time together.</p><p>In 2012, Scantlin was arrested for cocaine possession, driving under the influence and driving without a license in California. He could have served five years in jail but agreed to complete a rehabilitation program in order to erase his potential sentence.

The following year, Scantlin was sued by American Express for non-payment of debut. In 2015, he was arrested at the Denver International Airport after entering a restricted area by taking a ride on the baggage carousel. That year, he had numerous run-ins with the law. He was arrested also at the Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport for disorderly conduct and then was involved in a high-speed chase in Minnesota in July. He was charged with fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle, a felony. The charges were ultimately dropped.</p><p>In early 2016, Scantlin tried to re-enter the house he had lost via a foreclosure process the previous year. He was arrested for destroying property inside the residence. In August of that year, he was arrested for attaching a fake explosive device to his vehicles in an effort to deter theft.
