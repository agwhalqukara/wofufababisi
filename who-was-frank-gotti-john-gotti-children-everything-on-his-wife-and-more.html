The guy with the mini-bike was letting his friends use the bike in turn.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as you might expect the son of a gangster to do, Frank took his friend’s bike and started using it without any proper instructions and started moving towards the road.&nbsp;</p><p>There, he was hit by the car of his neighbor John Favara, who was riding the car. Despite he died because of the accident, John was let free because he had no fault in the accident.&nbsp;</p><p>Frank died that day, but things became difficult for John. As expected, he disappeared a few days later and then was never found.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, he was declared dead but no proof of that is yet found. Some say that he was dismembered and mixed into concrete, whereas some say that he was first killed and then melted with acid.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, Frank Gotti’s Gambino family had already left for Florida about 3 days before John’s disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Another protest against police brutality is happening in Memphis tonight.
